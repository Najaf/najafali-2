  <p>👋🏾 I'm a British immigrant to Japan. I live in Japan because I like it here more than anywhere else.</p>

  <!--<p>I speak fluent Japanese, well enough that my code switch is fast and easy, and I can use circumlocution and other tactics to survive in any conversation. I learned Japanese primarily by drinking with Japanese people. I try to cook but mostly end up eating out, so probably know Sendai's restaurants better than most natives here.</p>-->

  <p>I was born in the UK and moved around to a number of different countries, before graduating and going to Japan for the first time on the JET programme in 2006. After a ten year break in the UK where I founded a software development consultancy and had a couple of children, I moved back to Japan in August 2018.</p>
